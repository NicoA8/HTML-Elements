This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links.
After completing this project, I have accomplished:

- Properly seting up html files accordingly;
- Linked html files together;
- Inputed images with alternative text;
- Created ordered and unordered lists;
- Added in cooking notes by emphasizing them at bottom of the page;
- Added a Back Home button on sites to go back to starting page;
